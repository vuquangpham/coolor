# Coolor App

Hmm, I have read about Coolor Project (through [DevEds's course](https://developedbyed.com/p/the-creative-javascript-course)).
So I try to research some thing about it :), and this project was born

## Library

- [ChromaJS](https://gka.github.io/chroma.js/)
- Basic Vanilla Javascript

And this's all about it. I have built it day by day, but I'm so busy today, so I uploaded it to my Github and I will finish it somedays.
